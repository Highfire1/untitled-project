# Untitled Repository App

A universal way to store data in an easily accessible way.

### User Goals:
- load faster than notion
- seamless data syncing between devices
- more powerful than obsidian (no requirement that files are markdown compatible)
  - built in support for tables, resizable images, latex, and more
- supports offline viewing (still unsure about offline editing)
- files can be in pageless OR page form (so you can use this app to write your resume)
- supports 1 000 000+ files in one repository without slowing down
- ability to use it as a cms system
- native/core table functionality (similar to notion databases but probably less powerful)

### Development Goals:
- Open Source and non-proprietary file format
- data is file-based and backed by a git repository
- it is possible to write plugins/extensions to improve the functionality of the application

### What it cannot do (or far future goals):
- user management / account based access
- slides / other file formats - this is mainly for text editing

### Why?
Notion is slow, and also wants me to get used to the pro plan while i am a student so that i will pay $120/year for the rest of my life. While financially speaking that isn't a lot of money, Notion also uses proprietary file formats, and it is not easy to get your data out once it is in. 

Obsidian is kneecapped in several ways - frankly the plugin system is atrocious and using it feels like a chore instead of an adventure. (yes i know that sounds like silicon valley gibberish but i don't know how to better describe it)

Honestly, the google ecosystem is pretty good. From a user perspective my only annoyance is that navigating between files isn't great but otherwise its honestly pretty flawless. The elephant in the room is of course that you are wholly and utterly reliant on Google. If Google terminates your account for any reason, you instantly lose access to everything. My Google account is my personal email, and my authentication method for every single website I have an account on, my access to a cloud server, a large majority of my media consumption (youtube), and so much more. Putting even more information into their hands isn't without risk.

### What's next?
At this point, this is a specification for a plan for a project - a project that would take hundreds of hours to implement with no guarantee of success. I may decide to make a basic implementation at some point, but for now this is just that, an idea.
